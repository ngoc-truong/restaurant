# Restaurant Page

In this project a simple fictional restaurant page was designed. The focus was not
on aesthetical design but rather on practicing how to use webpack
and ES6 modules. The DOM was created with Javascript and not hard-coded into HTML. This project was part of the Javascript track on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page), an open source online curriculum to learn full stack web development.
